# SpinBike CI / Deploy Constraints

## Self-hosted runner: download-and-install only — NEVER build Rust locally

The `spinbike-deploy` self-hosted runner runs on the user's dev PC. Deploy jobs must NEVER run `cargo build`, `trunk build`, or any Rust/WASM compilation — `target/` balloons to 10-20 GB.

**Correct pattern:**
1. `build` job on `ubuntu-latest` → `actions/upload-artifact`
2. `deploy-*` job on `spinbike-deploy` (`needs: [build]`) → `actions/download-artifact`
3. Deploy job only does:
   - `install -Dm755 spinbike-server /opt/spinbike/{dev,prod}/spinbike-server`
   - `sudo -n systemctl restart spinbike{-dev,}.service`
   - Health + smoke checks

**Wrong:** any `cargo`/`trunk` command in the self-hosted job body.

When designing ANY CI workflow touching the self-hosted runner, the workflow must use `needs: [<build-job>]` + `actions/download-artifact`. No Rust build commands on the runner.

## Subagent prompts must not instruct local Rust builds

When dispatching subagents to implement SpinBike Rust/Leptos tasks, the prompt must NOT tell them to run `cargo test`, `cargo build`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo check`, or `trunk build` — even for TDD RED/GREEN verification. CI is authoritative.

**Correct subagent instruction pattern:**
1. Write code + tests
2. `cargo fmt --all --check` (the ONE allowed local cargo command)
3. `git add <explicit paths>` + `git commit`
4. Report DONE / BLOCKED

Skip the compile-and-verify step. If a step genuinely requires a local build (e.g. verify a new WASM signature compiles before handing off), note it explicitly and justify — never include it as a default TDD step.

## Git staging: never `git add -A` or `git add .`

The repo root regularly accumulates untracked artefacts that must NOT be committed:
- Playwright snapshot YAMLs: `prod-reports.yml`, `desk-snap.yml`, `*-snap.yml`
- Debug PNGs from preview runs
- Occasional dev DBs

`.gitignore` catches most but not all (new snapshot naming slips through).

**Always:** use explicit file paths (`git add path1 path2`) or `git add -u` (only modifies tracked files).

**Before any commit:** run `git status --short` to audit what would be staged.

## Push gate on docs-only branches (pre-push-test-check hook)

The airuleset pre-push hook blocks `git push` when the branch (vs origin/main)
contains any `fix(...)`-prefixed commit with no test commit before it — even
when every change is docs/config (Gate 2 false positive; the block message
goes to stdout, so the tool error shows only "No stderr output").

Fix: the bypass marker is honored ONLY on the LATEST commit (never amend —
project convention). Add an empty marker commit, then push:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: push gate [no-test: docs-only branch — no runtime code since main]"
git push origin dev
```

Never use this for branches with real code fixes — those need RED→GREEN.
